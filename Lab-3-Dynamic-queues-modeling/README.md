# Laboratory work 3. Dynamic queues modeling

## 1) General queue
## 2) Shortest queue
## 3) Dynamic General queue
## 4) Dynamic Shortest queue

Num of servers: 4 (4 or 5 for dynamic case)
Probability to wait for customers: ~50% (fit feasible parameters)
Random arrival & Random Service (the same for all servers)

### Go
Implement and compare all (four) models (by average queue size, total working etc.)
### Python
Draw server's dynamic through the time (for dynamic queues)

# Laboratory work 4. Dynamic queues modeling

> Please modify the example (`DEVSEXAMPLE.py`) so that 
the accuracy of one of the parameters (for example, server utilization or customers queue length) is set to specific value.
> After that you should make several test runs and estimate sufficient number of replications to achieve the specified accuracy.
> If the accuracy is not achieved, repeat the procedure again. Computational technology is on your own decision.
